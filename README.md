# Animal Crossing Apps - UI Clone 

This an UI Clone based on [Animal Crossing: New Horizon](https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/). The intention is recreated the APP available in the game using only HTML and CSS.

You can see on codepen too: https://codepen.io/andreserudo/pen/dyWGmry

## How is it going?

So far, you can compare what I've done. On the left my work and on the right the game:
